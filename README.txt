This repo contains various bits of code from here and there that I've written since
October 2012, which is when I started uni. None of the code is guarenteed to work
in anyway on your system or even mine, however, feel free to utilise the code as you
want, although it would be nice if you gave me credit if you use my code wholley or
in part in your projects.

Thanks!
Lewis
