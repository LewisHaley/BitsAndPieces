Labyrinth is a game made by Marc Di Luzio, Lewis Hayley and Gary Nisbet.
It has been produced for our third year Programming assignemnt using NGL, OpenGL and QT, written in c++.

This is a BETA released, primarily for bug testing and feedback.
Feel free to contact us at marcdiluzio@gmail.com

The .dlls provided here are provided simply for the testing of the product and should not be used for
any other purposes.

Known problems:

For Windows XP and/or 32-bit machines, if the game will not run try deleting the openGL32.dll
this seems to work in some cases, but i'm working on a permanent fix

If the display is very strange (black with little bits of colour), pressing 1 or 2 will swap to
the simple shaders

Please report back any other problems to marc.diluzio@gmail.com with system specs
<!--DO NOT DO THIS--> This project is an old project which we are no longer working on AT ALL.
You can email me (Lewis) about this regarding _code_content_ and I will attempt to answer your
questions, however we will not ammend, change, or revisit any part of this code. Ever.
